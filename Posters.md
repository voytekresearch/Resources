Quick tips for poster making:
- Broadly, use a top to bottom / left to right ordering
- Avoid words, pictures & graphs are better
- Use section headings (titles) to tell the story (titles are results)
- The main focus (the main result / main idea) of the poster of should be in the middle
- Don't overcrowd things - leave some space for things to 'breath'
