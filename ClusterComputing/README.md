# Cluster Computing

While many of the tasks done with lab software packages run quickly and can be multiprocessed on one's local computer simply by using the n_jobs argument in many of our functions, there are increasingly many use cases where a computing cluster would save time (e.g. sliding-window spectral parameterization where each time point is parameterized). 

## SSRDE
The Social Sciences Computing Facility (SSCF) maintains a [Social Sciences Research & Development Environment (SSRDE) cluster](https://sscf.ucsd.edu/ssrde). It is available to all Division affiliates (faculty, staff, and graduate students). The general queue contains eight nodes with 72 cores and 256 RAM and two nodes with 56 cores and 512 GB RAM, as well as a few other partitions that you can use if beneficial to your specific situation (see [here](https://sscf.ucsd.edu/ssrde/cluster-specifications)).

## Getting Started on SSRDE
The [Quick Start Guide](https://sscf.ucsd.edu/ssrde/quick-start-guide) available on their website makes it straightforward to set up your account and begin using the cluster. If you are using Python, they also have a useful guide for [Configuring Python for SSRDE](https://sscf.ucsd.edu/ssrde/learning-resources/configuring-python-for-ssrde) to help you set up a virtual environment to run your Python script within.
