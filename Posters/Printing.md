# Printing a Poster at UCSD

UCSD ACMS services offers cheap and pretty quick poster printing, which is usually the preferred option to print a poster. It is possible to print directly from your laptop [instructions](https://acms.ucsd.edu/students/print/remoteprint.html), but this can be finicky to set up. So if you're in a rush, or if you won't be printing posters several times, it is easiest to go to a UCSD computer lab (e.g. in the basement of the Applied Math & Physics building) and print the poster there. Here are instructions for doing that.

Before you are able to print a poster, you need to have a printing account. The login will be something like ‘cg42sc’ and the pw is in an email you received. If you don’t have a login, then Brad needs to email ACMS, as described here: http://acms.ucsd.edu/info/recharge.html


## Poster printing steps
0. On your personal computer, make a poster with the desired dimensions (either length or width must be 36" or 42") and save as pdf.
1. Log into the lab computer with your UCSD username and password
2. Log into remote printing at https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/accttools-cgi-bin/rpauth.cgi using your printing account and password emailed.
    a. Choose the cplot printer according to the size and paper you want (e.g. cplot1_sg36 DesignJet T1000ps in apm-1426)
    b. It is a good idea to first test printing using the "np" printers (e.g. cplot1_np DesignJet T1000ps in apm-1426) so you won't be charged but can make sure that the poster would come out looking right.
3. Open the pdf in Adobe Acrobat Reader.
4. File > Print. Choose the printer HP Designjet T1100ps (print.ucsd.edu)
5. Select 'Actual size"
6. Properties > Advanced
  a. For "Paper Size" select "PostScript Custom Page Size" and then set the Width and Height as the dimensions of the pdf
  b. If you don't remember the dimensions of the pdf, go to File > Properties.
  c. For "TrueType Font" select "Download as Softfont"
7. Click "OK" out of the Properties window, and make sure the preview looks good in the "Print" window. Click Print.
8. Check if your poster made it into the print queue: http://cplot.ucsd.edu/lp-cgi-bin/checkqueue.cgi
  a. If you did a test print to np: http://ieng9.ucsd.edu/~lp/cplot1_np42/?C=M;O=D for 42" or http://ieng9.ucsd.edu/~lp/cplot1_np/?C=M;O=D for 36". You should be able to find your username at the top of the list and click on it to see a preview of your poster and how much it would cost
