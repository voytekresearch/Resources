# Voytek Lab Resources Page

All Voytek Lab resources are available on the [Resources Wiki](https://github.com/voytekresearch/Resources/wiki). The wiki contains useful links and guidelines for basic lab things. Navigate within the wiki or using the guide below.

## Getting Started
If you are just joining the lab, start with the [onboarding](https://github.com/voytekresearch/Resources/wiki/Onboarding) page. After that, check out our list of useful [external resources](https://github.com/voytekresearch/Resources/wiki/External-Resources).

## Coding
If you will be writing code with the VoytekLab, please check out our [Coding Standard Operating Procedures](https://github.com/voytekresearch/Resources/wiki/Coding-SOP).

## Cluster Computing
If you are running CPU-heavy code, it may be worth looking into running your code on a cluster. For more information, check out our [Cluster Computing](https://github.com/voytekresearch/Resources/tree/master/ClusterComputing) page.

## Posters
Need a poster for a conference? To learn how to construct and print, check out our [Posters](https://github.com/voytekresearch/Resources/wiki/Posters) page. Poster templates are available [here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/Resources/tree/master/Posters/Templates).

## Writing
Need help writing an abstract? Check out our [Writing Abstracts](https://github.com/voytekresearch/Resources/wiki/Writing-Abstracts) page. 

## Running EEG
