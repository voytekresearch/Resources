# Onboarding

How to get started with the Voytek lab.

## Initial Set Up

#### Lab Communication

The lab uses two main communication channels: 
- Slack, which is basically a chat-room app, and an e-mail listserve
- An e-mail listserve for everyone in the lab

You can request access to both by sending an e-mail to voyteklab@gmail.com. You can also ask any lab member to invite you to the Slack channel. 

#### Keys

To get a code to the SSRB door, a Voytek Lab person will email lock-request@cogsci.ucsd.edu with the name, email, and undergraduate or graduate status of the person. 

To get a key to Social Sciences Research Building SSRB, contact the cog sci admin, Natalie at nguaring@ucsd.edu telling her you're rotating in the Voytek lab (SSRB 213) and are in what grad program. You'll need to bring $15 exact cash deposit to her office (Cog Sci Building 145) to get the key.

#### Ethics requirements:

To work with human data you must complete two tutorials below. Email the pdf results to voyteklab@gmail.com

CITI training:
- Go to: www.citiprogram.org and create an account 
- Complete the Social & Behavioral Research Basic/Refresher Course 

HIPAA 
- Go to: https://irb.ucsd.edu/hipaatutorial/login.shtml
- Enter your information and complete the tutorial

Once you have completed these trainings, you should e-mail the certificates to voyteklab@gmail.com

#### Software Licenses

For Matlab, if you are a UCSD student, you should be able to download Matlab with a working license [here](https://matlab.ucsd.edu/student.html). Otherwise, send an email to sscf-cogsci@ucsd.edu and tell them you want a MATLAB license for working in Brad's lab

## Lab Resources and Projects

[Voytek Lab website](http://voyteklab.com), including [publications](http://voyteklab.com/publications/).

Familiarize yourself with our [public code](https://github.com/voytekresearch/VoytekLab), and [projects in progress](https://github.com/voytekresearch/VoytekLabPrivate).

The lab has internal [tutorials](https://github.com/voytekresearch/tutorials) for common electrophysiological analyses, as well as dedicated [tutorials](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp/tree/master/tutorials) in [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp), our main neural time-series analysis package.

The lab also builds specialized analysis software for analyzing neural electrophysiology, including our package "fitting oscillations and one-over-f", or "fooof", which also has detailed [tutorials](https://github.com/voytekresearch/fooof/blob/master/tutorial/01-ModelDescription.ipynb).

The lab also uses a shared [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9R6DF7z7yLbfmFFX3p5NmY4OXozcENmOE5NemJtcm5TTC1DRFllelVTTVI1WkFLQktzUlE&usp=sharing) for sharing some documents. Ask a lab member for access if you need it. 

Logging into SDSC-hosted network storage:

For Mac: Finder > Go > Connect to Server (or Cmd+K)
Server address: smb://ps-074.sdsc.edu/voyteklab

For Windows: (anyone out here?)

Login information is the same as UCSD active directory (AD) login.

## End Message

Lastly, there are a lot of great people working on a lot of exciting projects in this lab and you are highly encouraged to ask them about what they're working on. Everybody here is very friendly and likes to talk about what they're doing. Also, don't let yourself be intimidated by science. It's normal to be very, very confused in a computational and theoretical neuroscience lab. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you are confused and if you're working on a big project, try not to feel overwhelmed and take it one step at a time.

Best of luck!
