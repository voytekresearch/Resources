For [python](https://www.python.org), we recommend using [conda](https://anaconda.org) as a package and environment manager. We use [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) a lot, which come packaged with anaconda.

For learning Python, [Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp) has a lot of great materials, including a [Whirl Wind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython), which is available as sets of Jupyter notebooks.

For improving programming skills, Codecademy's [python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) and [git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) courses are great (and free!).

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a large component of analyzing time series data, and a large part of what the lab does. If you want to learn a bit more about DSP, there is a great [Interactive Guide](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/) and there is also a freely available textbook, [DSP for Scientists and Engineers](http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm).

For computational modeling of biological neurons, check out [this interactive introduction by Jack Terwilliger](http://jackterwilliger.com/biological-neural-networks-part-i-spiking-neurons/).

For Data Science, check out the [Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook), also by Jake Vanderplas. You can also look at the tutorials for [Professor Voytek's UC San Diego Data Science in Practice class (COGS 108)](https://github.com/COGS108/Tutorials) (helpfully put together by Voyteklab PhD student, [Tom Donoghue](https://tomdonoghue.github.io/)). These will step you through the basics, which software to download, how to set up your python and jupyter environments, etc.

It's also helpful to know the basic data science toolkit:
* Anaconda to manage python and packages
* Jupyter notebooks for quick scripting
* Github for version control
* matplotlib + numpy + scipy + pandas + scikit-learn + statsmodels + nltk + BeautifulSoup + bokeh for statistics and data visualization
