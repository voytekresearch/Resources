For [python](https://www.python.org), we recommend using [conda](https://anaconda.org) as a package and environment manager. We use [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) a lot, which come packaged with anaconda. 

For learning Python, [Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp) has a lot of great materials, including a [Whirl Wind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) and his [Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook), both available as sets of Juyter notebooks. 

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a large component of analyzing time series data. If you want to learn a bit more about DSP, there is a great [Interactive Guide](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/) and/or a freely available textbook, [DSP for Scientists and Engineers](http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm).
